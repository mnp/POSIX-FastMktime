=head1 NAME

POSIX::FastMktime - A drop-in mktime() replacement that's faster in
one specific but common, use case.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use POSIX::FastMktime;
    $time_t = POSIX::fast_mktime( 0, 30, 10, 12, 11, 95 );
    print "Date = ", POSIX::ctime($time_t);

=head1 ABSTRACT

Call it just like you would POSIX::mktime(), but with fast_mktime().

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Drop-in POSIX::mktime() replacement.  This is optimized for repeated
calls within the same date by caching previous result: if the cache
applies, it just performs the H:M:S calculation within the same day,
if not it falls through to POSIX::mktime() and stores the result for
next invocation.


=head1 EXPORT

fast_mkime()


=cut


require Exporter;
our @ISA    = qw(Exporter);
our @EXPORT = qw(fast_mktime);

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

There is only one function provided.

=item C<fast_mktime>

Given the same arguments as mktime(), sec, min, hour, etc., returns a
calendar time. If fast_mktime() was called before, and if the day
given is the same as the previous call, then 

Otherwise, the behavior will be the same as mktime().

=cut

# This is the day and result cache.
my $mk_day = 0;
my $mk_mon = 0;
my $mk_year = 0;
my $mk_time = 0;

sub fast_mktime {
  my ($s, $m, $h, $day, $mon, $year) = @_;
  my $time;
  my $hmsarg = 3600 * $h + 60 * $m + $s;

  if ($hmsarg && $mk_day == $day && $mk_mon == $mon && $mk_year == $year) {
    $time = $mk_time + $hmsarg;
  }
  else {
    $mk_time = POSIX::mktime(0, 0, 0, $day, $mon, $year);
    $time = $mk_time ? $mk_time + $hmsarg : undef;
    $mk_day = $day;
    $mk_mon = $mon;
    $mk_year = $year;
  }

  return $time;
}
