POSIX-FastMktime

Drop-in POSIX::mktime() replacement.  This is optimized for repeated
calls within the same date by caching previous result: if the cache
applies, it just performs the H:M:S calculation within the same day,
if not it falls through to POSIX::mktime() and stores the result for
next invocation.

The example use case is parsing a log file with many entries in the
each day, where you might find mktime() profiling too hot.
Benchmarking fast_mktime() vs mktime() shows around 2x improvement
in this isolated case. I also poked at timegm_nocheck() for
curiosity.  The benchmark runs a million sequential dates, spread
over a year, through each candidate.

My quadcore 2.67ghz:

Benchmark: timing 5 iterations of FastMktime::fast_mktime, POSIX::mktime, TIME::Local::timegm_nocheck...
FastMktime::fast_mktime:  6 wallclock secs ( 6.59 usr +  0.02 sys =  6.61 CPU) @  0.76/s (n=5)
POSIX::mktime: 13 wallclock secs ( 6.79 usr +  6.17 sys = 12.96 CPU) @  0.39/s (n=5)
TIME::Local::timegm_nocheck: 13 wallclock secs (13.25 usr +  0.00 sys = 13.25 CPU) @  0.38/s (n=5)
